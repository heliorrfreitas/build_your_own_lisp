# Build Your Own Lisp in C

I am working through the book Build Your Own Lisp. I am reading it online at buildyourownlisp.com

The idea of this book is to create a modified version of Lisp while learning how to code in C. 

The result of this project is a REPL in which we can enter commands from the programming language built.
