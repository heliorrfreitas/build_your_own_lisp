Struct definition
structures are used to create new types. Structures are several variables bundled together into a single package.

typedef struct {
	float x;
	float y;
} point;

In the example above it was created a structure that has two variables(x and y). The name of this new type is point.

To use the new structure use the commands below:

point p;
p.x = 10.1;
p.y = 5.0;
