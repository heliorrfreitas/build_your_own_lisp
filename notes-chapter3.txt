Notes

Struct definition
structures are used to create new types. Structures are several variables bundled together into a single package.

typedef struct {
	float x;
	float y;
} point;

In the example above it was created a structure that has two variables(x and y). The name of this new type is point.

To use the new structure use the commands below:

point p;
p.x = 10.1;
p.y = 5.0;

› Use a for loop to print out Hello World! five times.
› Use a while loop to print out Hello World! five times.
› Declare a function that outputs Hello World! n number of times. Call this from main.

› What built in types are there other than the ones listed?
	In the chapter the following built in types were listed: void, char, int, long, float, and double.
	We can modify these types using the following modifiers: signed, unsigned, short, long

› What other conditional operators are there other than greater than >, and less than <?
	>= 	greater than or equal to
	<=	less than or equal to
	==	equal to
	!=	different of

› What other mathematical operators are there other than add +, and subtract -?
	*	multiplication
	/	division
	%	modulus
	^	to the power of

	The operators below always do the their respective operation using the left operand and the right operand, the result is assigned to the left operand. Example,
	int a = 1;
	int b = 2;
	a += b is the same as a = a + b

	+= 	
	-=	it is used to subtract the left operand off the right operand and assign the result to the left operand.
	*=	it is used to multiply the left operand and the right operand and assign the result to the left operand.
	/=
	%=
	^= 
	

› What is the += operator, and how does it work?
	this one is used to add the left operand and the right operand and assign the result to the left operand.

› What is the do loop, and how does it work?
	the do while loop executes at least once. Then, it verifies the condition, if the condition is not satified it ends. 

› What is the switch statement and how does it work?
	The switch statement gets a value that is integral or an enumerated type.

	Then it evalutes this value and take to the case which

› What is the continue keyword and what does it do?
› What does the typedef keyword do exactly?
